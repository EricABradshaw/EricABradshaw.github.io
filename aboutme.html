						<h3>Who am I?</h3>
						<p>As a self-defined problem solver and nerd, I know the computer science field is right for me, though it took me a while to realize this.<br />
							I am an achievement-based self-motivater, I always try to learn new concepts, and I am annoyingly persistent at making things work.<br />
							The best attribute about myself is that I learn hard from my mistakes, as I see failure as the best foundation for success.

								<h3>Work History</h3>
								<p>After graduating high school in 2014, I quickly learned I had a love for crafting meals for others. I found myself working in the restaurant business,
									even dropping out of college to do so. At that time, I was a physics major, but that only lasted for one semester.<br />
									I worked myself through the ranks, becoming a kitchen manager and the chef of a local restaurant. After working many long and hard hours
									creating features and recipes, ordering product, and fulfilling the many duties of a chef, I decided it was time for the next chapter
									of my life.<br /><br />I continued my academic career, but I continued to work; however, after the restaurant shut down for repairs after suffering from a 
									fire, I did not return. Currently I am employed at a chain BBQ restaurant as the PM prep cook until an opportunity fitting my aspirations presents itself.
								</p>

								<h3>Hobbies</h3>
								<p>Though I take my work very seriously, I am a fun loving individual that enjoys many hobbies in my limited free time.<br />
									My favorite past time is putting together jigsaw puzzles. I tend to keep it simple with 1000 piece puzzles, but I have been considering
									attempting a more challenging puzzle. I also enjoy reading, specifically science-fiction and dystopian books. The most interesting book I have recently
									read is <em>The Three-Body Problem</em> by Cixin Liu. I enjoy the author Blake Crouch's books, and I am currently starting Ben Oliver's <em>The Loop</em> trilogy.
									When with friends and family, I enjoy playing tabletop games, so much that I will have fun losing at Monopoly. Finally, I am a lover of music. Most genres
									have a home in my heart!
