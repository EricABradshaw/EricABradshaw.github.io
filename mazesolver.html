								<h3>Purpose</h3>
								<p>
                                    Maze Solver is an application that reads text based mazes from a file. The contents of the file has maze representations
                                    for each maze as follows: row count, column count, and a matrix of the maze where 0 is a "wall", 1 is a "path", S is 
                                    "start" and E is "end". Solved mazes replace 1s with @s, representing the solution path.<br />
                                    The project was a lesson on utilizing data structures to programatically solve mazes or determine they are unsolvable.
                                    It also improved my understanding of Java at the time, specifcally in using JavaFX to create the GUI. Though this was a
                                    class project, I believe that it represents a good understanding of programming theory with data structures and algorithms.<br />
                                    The system uses a linked list stack and a automatically resizing set to solve the maze. These classes were constructed myself from scratch.
                                    Mazes are solved by the system using a depth-first search to find the next available path. When given more than one path option, all
                                    options are stored in the stack. Upon finding a dead-end, the system will pop the next available path from the stack and follow that path.
                                    If it is discovered no paths reach the end, the maze is deemed unsolvable. Otherwise, the path that leads to the end of the maze will be marked
                                    as part of the solution path and the maze will be rebuilt to represent this path.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Professor Reception</h3>
                                <p>My professor was impressed with the extra care that went into my code to discourage bugs, such as creating methods
                                    that consider if the start position was not in the first row but in the center and reserving some computational effort
                                    in the algorithm used when finding a dead-end. Project grade: >100%, A+.
